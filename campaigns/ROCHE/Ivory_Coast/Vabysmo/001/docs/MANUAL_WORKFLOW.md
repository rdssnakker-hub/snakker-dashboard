- Three-column value proposition grid:
  1. Mechanism Mastery (understand the science)
  2. Patient Selection (identify ideal patients)
  3. Early Adopter Stories (real clinic examples)
- Lead capture form with fields: Name, Email, Phone, Timezone, Preferred Time
- [SCHEDULE TRAINING] CTA button (blue, prominent)
- Branded confirmation page after submission

OVERALL DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Professional healthcare/clinical tone
