## Customer Objectives (3 Primary Goals)

### 1. **Education** 📚
**What they want:** HCPs to understand Vabysmo's mechanism of action  
**Key message:** "Why bispecific (2 pathways) beats monotherapy (1 pathway)"  
**Success metric:** HCP completes 4-section Snak™ experience, watches mechanism animation  

### 2. **Awareness** 🎯
**What they want:** Top-of-mind product presence in ophthalmologist circles  
**Key message:** "Vabysmo is different—and here's why"  
**Success metric:** 500+ HCPs see campaign assets (banners, LinkedIn, email, WhatsApp)  

### 3. **Lead Generation** 📝
**What they want:** Qualified leads for training programs  
**Key message:** "Request your personalized mechanism mastery training"  
**Success metric:** 50+ lead captures (name, email, phone, timezone)

## Target Audience

### Primary: Ophthalmologists (AMD specialists)
- **Geography:** Ivory Coast (West Africa)
- **Seniority:** Consultant & attending level
- **Specialization:** Retina/AMD care
- **Decision-making:** Own treatment protocols, influence hospital/clinic purchases
- **Pain point:** AMD patients plateau on single-pathway therapies; need better options
- **Motivation:** Education, peer validation, clinical evidence, ease of use

### Secondary: Clinic managers & nurses
- **Role:** Support ophthalmologists in treatment planning
- **Motivation:** Understanding mechanism helps explain to patients
- **Influence:** Can recommend to ophthalmologists

### Tertiary: Hospital administrators
- **Role:** Budget/procurement decisions
- **Motivation:** Cost-effectiveness, outcomes data
- **Note:** Not primary target for this campaign (focus on doctors first)

---

## Key Messages & Positioning

### Primary Message Hierarchy

#### 1. **"One Pathway Isn't Enough"** (Mechanism Advantage)
- **For ophthalmologists:** Standard AMD therapies block one pathway → temporary response
- **For Vabysmo:** Bispecific antibody blocks TWO pathways → sustained control
- **Why it matters:** Patients plateau on monotherapy; Vabysmo offers real alternative
- **Proof:** 2x longer duration (18.4 mo vs 9.6 mo), 2.3x higher response rate (58.4% vs 25%)

#### 2. **"The Patient You See Every Week"** (Problem Awareness)
- **For ophthalmologists:** AMD patient on standard therapy hitting a plateau
- **Their reality:** Patient's vision stabilizing but not improving; limited options
- **Vabysmo's answer:** Bispecific option offers new hope
- **Psychology:** Problem-first messaging (doctors recognize patient → then show solution)

#### 3. **"Master the Mechanism"** (Educational CTA)
- **For ophthalmologists:** Deep understanding of dual-pathway advantage
- **Deliverable:** Formal training program (virtual or in-person)
- **Value add:** Competitive advantage knowing mechanism well
